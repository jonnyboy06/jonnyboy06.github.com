	<h2 class="pos_right"> <div class="transbox3"> <p>There are many factors that have contributed to and shaped my life. As an African-American male in the city of Chicago, Illinois, life is not as easy as most places. There are always unbearable statistics I am put under and nearly always stereotyped as whatever the present interpretation of African Americans the media is portraying. However, my self-will to overcome all obstacles has propelled me forward through every storm of my life. In my life, I have faced many hurdles that required great strength and determination to jump over. This biographical essay is going to explain my endeavors, goals, and accomplishments. </p>
<p>The endeavors of life are different for every person in every different situation, and my situation is unique among others. I attended a private Christian elementary school name United Educational Cultural Academy (U.E.C.A.). There I received the foundation for attaining and applying knowledge. Their accelerated courses aided in preparing me for the real world. At U.E.C.A I skipped fourth grade due to academic achievements. Then I graduated as salutatorian in eighth grade and moved on to Martin Luther King Jr. College Preparatory High School. While I attended there, they possessed me with the tools to an upper hand in education. They also demonstrated the importance of giving back to the community.  Although King College Preparatory had everything I needed to become successful, I still sought an even more difficult challenge than the one King was presenting. Junior year of high school I departed from King and moved on to DeVry University Advantage Academy. At DeVry I have learned the importance of friendship, obtaining a strong work ethic, and managing time wisely. Now, I am a sixteen year old who is currently a senior in high school and sophomore in college, and when I graduate I will not only receive my diploma but an Associate degree in Network Systems Administration. In this dual enrollment program with DeVry University, I have flourished academically as well as maturely. This program has taught me an essential life lesson that has been engraved in my mind. I have not only endeavored Chicago educationally and mentally but as well as statistically.  The Schott Foundation for Public Education/National Student Clearinghouse/Study by Consortium on Chicago School Research as U of Chicago states that only thirty percent of black males in Chicago graduate from high school and of those only three percent gain a bachelor's degree by the age of twenty five.  I have overcome this statistic not to mention countless others. My means to endeavor the un-survivable are due to the goals that I constantly set in life.</p></h2>

<p> <h2 class="pos_right"> <div class="transbox4"> The goals I set for myself are really high and this contributes to my success. A prime example is the fact that I even dare to apply to such high standard prestigious institutions such as University of Missouri, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford, and California Institute of Technology.  These goals I set are practically dreams, and I dream big and am a firm believer that dreams come true. My current goals are to get accepted into one of the top colleges in America to pursue an education in either or both Mechanical Engineering, Animation, or Computer Engineering. Next my goal is to gain a high paying job where I can do what I love most and improve mankind interaction with not only each other but with the Earth and its surrounding neighbors. I have built these goals prior to high school. When I was younger, I was fascinated with heroes and how they made joy from so much sorrow that the world would bring to a person. My favorite hero was Blank Man, a hero that was portrayed by Damon Wayans. He was an African American in a low income community that made a difference. Then my interest in improving human life for the better derived from the Disney movie "Meet the Robinsons."  In this movie a young orphan named Lewis invents things improving human life. I have also prepared myself for the position I want to attain by taking the necessary courses in high school.</p>
<p>These goals and aspirations I have all have helped me accomplish so much.  As a firm believer of the United Negro College Fund slogan "A mind is a terrible thing to waste," I have made sure I have accomplished everything that I have put my mind to when the opportunity presents itself.  I have always wanted to win a competition, and I proved myself by coming in first place in the CCML geometry competition hosted at University of Chicago. I was also enlisted on the Dean's List for the fall of 2011.I am also a member of the National Honors Society. There are also accomplishments such as supporting the less fortunate in whichever way I can and aiding those who need help rather it's financially, physically, or mentally. </p></div>
